**1. Icon**
: By clicking on the Icon it can be changed to customize the look of the action.

**2. Label**
: By double-click on the Label it can be changed and by default it will be `Untitled`.

**3. Execution Mode**
: This can be changed to execute between `Group`-Execution and `Individual`-Execution.
    - **Group**: Performs the current action on all selected objects without separating them (Default Behavior)
    - **Individual**: Performs the current action on all selected objects individually. Therefore, the action is executed as many times as there are selected objects.

To add a Macro 4 Options are available.
:::

**âž• Add**

If the setting `Create Empty on Error` is checked it will create an empty Macro if no command is available. (Shortcut: `alt + ,`)

**ðŸ”§ Event**

**Context Menu**
