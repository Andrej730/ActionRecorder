# Welcome to ActionRecorder!

ActRec is an add-on developed to streamline your work in Blender

This add-on is similar to Affinity Photo and Photoshop's "Action"<br>
macro registration and batch processing


# Add-ons Explained

Convert complex, repetitive tasks into one click!

You have to remember is "Add" & "Play" Only!

Supported Versions: 2.83 to 2.9 (build version)

Simplify complex repetitive tasks, which were difficult to do with the standard “Repeat Last”(Shift+R) function of Blender, by registering multiple actions.

You can register, edit and play back various tasks as you wish

For example, with the touch of a button, you can do routine tasks such as adding instant coffee, milk and sugar while boiling water and adding hot water!

(I've thought about it a few times, but unfortunately this add-on only allows you to register work within Blender.)
